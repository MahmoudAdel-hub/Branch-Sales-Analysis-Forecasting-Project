## Introduction

In the context of retail or branch-based businesses, accurate sales forecasting is crucial for effective inventory management, resource allocation, and overall business planning. This project aims to leverage various analytical methods to enhance the accuracy of sales predictions for the upcoming four weeks.

## Features

- **ABC Analysis:** Utilizes ABC classification to categorize products based on their contribution to overall sales. This helps in focusing on high-value items for more accurate forecasting.

- **XYZ Analysis:** Classifies products based on their demand variability. This categorization aids in selecting appropriate forecasting models, with more sophisticated models applied to high-variability products.

- **Time Series Forecasting:** Employs time series models and methods to analyze historical sales data and predict future sales trends. This includes but is not limited to ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet models.

## Models and Methods

The forecasting models and methods implemented in this project include:
- ABC Analysis
- XYZ Analysis
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- LSTM Models
